<p>STB unveils a new four-year Tourism Development Fund (TDF), designed to&nbsp;catalyse&nbsp;the
creation of innovative and quality tourism products and experiences, and
capability and employee upgrading efforts among tourism-related enterprises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key enhancements to the latest tranche include increasing the grant cap
to support new and innovative events under the Kickstart Fund, and supporting
the development and enhancement of Singapore’s tourism experiences that
are virtual or include pre- and post-visit experiences under the Experience
Step-Up Fund to increase the attractiveness of Singapore to visitors.</p>
<p>With the focus for Singapore to become a sustainable urban destination,
STB will support sustainable development of tourism hardware and software
(i.e. events and experiences), which would create a holistic visitor experience
that is sustainable across all aspects and touchpoints. To complement this,
STB will also support building your workforce’s capabilities and development
of innovative solutions to capture opportunities from sustainable travel.</p>
